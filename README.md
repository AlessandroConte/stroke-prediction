# 🧠 Stroke Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person suffering a stroke based on medical and demographic data, using various machine learning models.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is currently a work in progress. The current version includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and class balancing with SMOTE.

---

## 📊 Objective

To build a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of stroke using structured healthcare data. The goal is to compare multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
